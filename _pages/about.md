Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Shuting, a master's student at ðŸŒŠ [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (EC93). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Beijing Jiaotong University and was proudly supervised by Prof. [Zhu Teng](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8902/).

My interests span AI Agent Systems, Go Microservices, and LLMs â€” specifically, the intersection of AI and software, to see how transformative AI can reshape our way of life and work.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations on interesting ideas! I'm also actively seeking full-time Software Engineer positions starting this fall (expected to graduate in 2026). Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:shuting@outlook.com).
